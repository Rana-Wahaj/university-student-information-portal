# university-student-information-portal
# THIS IS BASIC PROJECT, GOOD FOR 1ST SEMESTER STUDENTS PERSUING CS/SE AND STUDYING PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTAL
This project is model demonstration of how some university or big institution’s
portal should look like so that it is easier for students to be aware of their
updated class and bus time-tables.
Here student can have all the necessary information they will need. For each
year student, there is a class timetable with respect to his discipline and
section. Every student can check bus schedule for required day. This project is
important for fresh students who seem to have no clue about university
schedules and get hard time finding classrooms for respective courses. In
addition to this, this project allows administrator that is teacher, to do any
type of update in timetable without having to get in trouble with long
procedures of editing recorded data. The two main users of this project are
Administrator and Student, and two main divisions of this project are class
schedule and bus routine.routine. These are described as follows:

# Administrator:
This portion is password protected so that only administrator can access
important data. It offers variety of menus such as, add information, edit
information, delete information.
On administrator’s choice one option is selected and a separate function
performs the task. For example, add info function takes data input and stores it
while through edit and delete function admin can access already stored
information in a program.

# Student:
Since this function does not provide direct access of data to the user, no
password was required. However, student has to enter his/her batch,
discipline, and section in order to view information stored by his/her teacher.
Student is given a menu of what timetable he/she wishes to view; class’s or
bus. furthermore, student is required to enter the specific day he/she wishes
to view timetable for.
